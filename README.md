## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this solution to my second challenge from front-end coding challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io).

**This challenge was built using HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a very simple Order Summary UI

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Body backround (done with css)
